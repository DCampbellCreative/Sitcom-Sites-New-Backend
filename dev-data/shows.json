Daphne's most significant developing relationship over the course of the series is with Frasier Crane's younger brother, Niles Crane. Unbeknownst to Daphne, Niles falls in love with her at first sight. Despite the increasing obviousness of Niles' infatuation, Daphne remains utterly oblivious to Niles' feelings towards her, though they become increasingly close friends.  Niles finally confesses his feelings to her, and although she initially rejects him, saying she should go through with her promise, Daphne eventually changes her mind, abandoning her fiancé at the altar.",

In 1991, Martin was injured in the line of duty when he was shot after interrupting a robbery attempt in a convenience store. His injury inhibits him from living alone, and forces him to accept Frasier's invitation to live with him upon Frasier's return to Seattle. Martin soon grows close to his physical therapist Daphne Moon, and steadily becomes closer to both his sons, despite their different tastes and personalities.",

She has no shame about her promiscuity, which is the subject of many jokes and snide remarks, especially from Frasier's brother Niles. Roz quickly befriends Frasier's father, Martin and is the only regular character to address him as Marty. While Frasier and Niles are interested in high culture, Roz and Martin share a more down-to-earth view of life, and grow close over the series. Roz is also close to Martin's physical therapist (and later Niles' wife), Daphne Moon, due to the fact that they are the only two women who were constant in the Crane men's lives.",

KACL follows an advice or lifestyle talk format and appears to offer little or no political talk programming, the dominant form of talk radio when the program was being produced. It is portrayed as being just across the street from Café Nervosa.",

It is fictitiously located on the corner of the real-world 3rd and Pike Streets in Seattle and is portrayed as being just across the street from the also fictional KACL Radio Studios.
